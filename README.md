# Pong-Em
This game is a UT Austin-themed version of the classic arcade game "Pong," created by UT ECE students Janani Ramamoorthy and Alyssa Palacios.
The code runs on a TI MSPM0G3507 Microcontroller through Code Composer Studio. 
Most files included (i.e. Switch.c, Sound.h, LED.c, etc.) are needed for the game to actually run on the microcontroller and are primarily synatactical.
The game engine and display logic is in the Lab9Main.c file.
